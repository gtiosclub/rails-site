## Part 1: Setting up your Github

This tutorial will teach you how to build a Calculator app using Interface Builder and Storyboards.

Github is a platform to easily save your code onto a cloud where you can track the changes you've made over time. It also allows others to see and contribute to your open source code. If you haven't done so yet:

1. Sign up for an account at [Github](https://www.github.com)
2. Set up your github [SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

Then, you need to fork our Calculator-Template repository. Go to https://github.com/iosgatech/Calculator-Template, press the fork button on the top right, and select your own account to fork to.

</br>

You now have forked a repository! You now have copied over the repository over to your account, which now you can freely manipulate without modifying the original code.

But now you need to clone the repository that you just forked to your computer in order to edit it. Open up your terminal using <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> and then  typing in "terminal". Press enter and a terminal window should show up.

Navigate to the folder where you want to save your Xcode projects. For example, if you would like to save your Calculator directly to the desktop, first `cd` to `~/Desktop` by typing this into the terminal and pressing enter

```
cd ~/Desktop
```

Proceed to clone the repository in that directory by typing in this line and replacing `**your-username**` with your github username:

```
git clone git@github.com:**your-username**/Calculator-Template.git
```

A folder called `Calculator-Template` should show up.

### Recap

You forked and cloned the Calculator Template and you're ready to get started with the real meat of the tutorial.

### Next Time

We will crack open Interface Builder and learn the foundations of designing a user interface.
