## Announcements
Hey everyone, thanks for coming out to the first meeting on 8/30! We had a great turnout and we're excited for another great year.

If you haven't join the [iOS Club Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/iosgatech). Most of the information and annoucements will be on there!

Next week we'll be building your first iOS Application, we moved it up the list because we felt it was important to give you guys exposure, so we're gonna build a very basic number guessing application. The tutorial should be up on the website soon, but if not I'm going to try to see if we can livestream the meeting.

Remember, next week's meeting will be in Klaus 1443, not Howey L3.

Cyall there! 6PM Tuesday @ Klaus 1443
