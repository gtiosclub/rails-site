## Announcements
Hey everyone, thanks for coming out to the third meeting on 9/13! We had an airwatch presentation about how to evaluate and negotiate a job offer, and then we taught optionals. I have a set of challenges that we didn't have time to complete up on [https://www.github.com/iosgatech/InterviewQuestions](https://www.github.com/iosgatech/InterviewQuestions). If you want some practice with optionals, I'd recommend looking through the solutions section.

**SINCE NEXT WEEK IS CAREER FAIR WEEK, THERE IS NO MEETING.** We resume meetings with Cal-culator Part 1 on 9/27 the week after career fair week.

Cyall there! 9/27, 6PM Tuesday @ Klaus 1443

If you haven't joined the [iOS Club Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/iosgatech). Most of the information and annoucements will be on there!
