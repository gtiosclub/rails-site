## Part 1: Getting Started

This tutorial will teach you how to build a Guess the Number game through the use of Interface builder and Storyboards!

The first thing that you will do is create the project within Xcode. So, open up Xcode, and you should be able to see this screen:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/guessthenumber/xcodeMainScreen.png" align="center" style="max-width:75%"> </p>

Click on "Create a new Xcode project", then a default screen should appear:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/guessthenumber/createProject.png" align="center" style="max-width:75%"> </p>

Go ahead and click "Next", and on the next screen, make your project's name "Guess The Number":

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/guessthenumber/inputProjectName.png" align="center" style="max-width:75%"> </p>

Click "Next", and then save the project anywhere you want to on your computer:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/guessthenumber/saveProject.png" align="center" style="max-width:75%"> </p>
